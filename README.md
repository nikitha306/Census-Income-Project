# Census-Income-Project
A machine learning project 
In this project, first, the preprocess the data and then develop an
understanding of the different features of the data by performing exploratory
analysis and creating visualizations. 

Further, after having sufficient knowledge
about the attributes, we will perform a predictive task of classification to predict
whether an individual makes over 50,000 a year or less by using different
machine learning algorithms.
